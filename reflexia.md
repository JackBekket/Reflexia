# reflexia

## Summary

This Go code is a package named "reflexia" that performs a task related to code analysis and documentation generation. It imports several packages, including the standard library packages "fmt", "go/parser", "go/token", "log", "os", "path/filepath", and "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5". It also imports custom packages "github.com/JackBekket/Reflexia/lib/ai" and "github.com/JackBekket/Reflexia/lib/github".

The code defines a struct named "Package" that represents a Go package. It has fields for the package name and a slice of file paths.

The main function, "Reflexate", takes a repository URL as an argument. It first loads environment variables from a .env file and checks if the "REPO_LINK" environment variable is set. If not, it logs a fatal error.

Next, it creates a temporary directory named "temp" and clones the repository from the "REPO_LINK" environment variable into this directory.

The function then walks through the files in the "temp" directory. If a file has a ".go" extension, it parses the file and adds it to a map of packages. If a package does not already exist in the map, it creates a new package. The package name is the name of the Go package in the file and the file path is added to the package's list of files.

Finally, the function iterates over the packages and files. For each file, it reads the file content and checks if the file is a "main.go" file. If it is, it calls the "CreateDoc" function from the "ai" package to generate documentation for the file. If the file is not a "main.go" file, it calls the "TestGenerateContent" function from the "ai" package to generate some content. After processing all files, it removes the "temp" directory.

This code seems to be part of a larger system that uses AI to generate documentation and content for Go code.
