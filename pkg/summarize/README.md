# Summarize

This package provides a service for summarizing code and generating summaries for files based on a given prompt and content. It utilizes the LangChain library for interacting with language models and the reflexia/pkg/project package for handling project configurations.

The package structure is as follows:

```
pkg/summarize/summarize.go
```

## SummarizerService

The SummarizerService type holds the necessary information for the summarization process, including the HelperURL, Model, ApiToken, Network, and LlmOptions.

The service provides three main functions:

1. CodeSummaryRequest: This function takes a prompt and content as input and calls the helper.GenerateContentInstruction function with the provided parameters. It returns the response and any error encountered during the process.

2. SummarizeRequest: Similar to CodeSummaryRequest, this function also takes a prompt and content as input and calls the helper.GenerateContentInstruction function. It returns the response and any error encountered during the process.

3. SummarizeCode: This function takes a projectConfig as input and creates a map to store file paths and summaries. It then walks through the project directory, ignoring files specified in .gitignore. For each file, it checks if the file extension matches any of the file filters specified in projectConfig. If a match is found, it reads the file content, calculates the relative path, and calls s.CodeSummaryRequest to generate a summary. The summary is then stored in the fileMap along with the relative path. Finally, the function returns the fileMap and any error encountered during the process.

## Edge Cases

The application can be launched with no environment variables, config files, CLI arguments, or flags.
