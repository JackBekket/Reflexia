## Code Summary

### SummarizerService

The SummarizerService is responsible for handling code summarization requests. It has the following fields:

- HelperURL: URL for the helper service
- Model: Name of the language model to use
- ApiToken: API token for the language model
- Network: Network to use for communication with the language model
- LlmOptions: Options for the language model

The service has three main functions:

1. CodeSummaryRequest: Takes a prompt and content as input and calls the helper service to generate a summary. Returns the response and any error encountered.

2. SummarizeRequest: Similar to CodeSummaryRequest, but it takes a prompt and content as input and calls the helper service to generate a summary. Returns the response and any error encountered.

3. SummarizeCode: Takes a project configuration as input and walks through the project directory. For each file that matches the file filter in the project configuration, it reads the file content, calculates the relative path, and calls CodeSummaryRequest to get the summary. Stores the summary in a map with the relative path as the key and returns the map and any error encountered.

### Edge Cases
