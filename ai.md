## Summary

This Go code is part of a package named "ai". It imports several packages including "log", "os", "github.com/JackBekket/hellper/lib/langchain", and "github.com/joho/godotenv". The package contains several functions for generating prompts for code documentation and summaries, as well as generating content based on these prompts.

The functions are:

1. `GenerateCommentForFunction(code string) (string)`: This function takes a string of code as input and returns a string that instructs the user to refactor the code, adding commentaries about the function algorithm.

2. `GenerateSummaryPromt(code string) (string)`: This function takes a string of code as input and returns a string that instructs the user to summarize the code.

3. `GenerateDocumentationPromt(code string) (string)`: This function takes a string of code as input and returns a string that instructs the user to generate documentation for the code.

4. `GenerateContent(base_url string, promt string, model_name string, api_token string, network string) (string)`: This function generates content based on the provided base URL, prompt, model name, API token, and network. It uses the helper package to generate the content.

5. `TestGenerateContent(initial_promt string) (string)`: This function tests the `GenerateContent` function by generating a summary of the provided code. It retrieves the AI URL, model, API token, and network from environment variables.

6. `GetSummaryPackage(initial_promt string) (string)`: This function wraps the `TestGenerateContent` function and returns the summary of the provided code.

7. `CreateDoc(code string) (string)`: This function generates documentation for the provided code. It retrieves the AI URL, model, API token, and network from environment variables.

8. `getEnv()`: This function loads environment variables from a .env file.

The environment variables used in this code include "AI_URL", "MODEL", "API_TOKEN", and "NETWORK".

Please note that the actual content generation is handled by the helper package, which is not included in this code snippet.
