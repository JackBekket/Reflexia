# main

## Documentation

This Go code snippet is designed to interact with a Git repository and perform some actions related to it. Let's break down the code and understand its purpose.

First, the code imports several packages:

1. `log`: This package is used for logging messages to the console.
2. `os`: This package provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as reading environment variables.
3. `reflexia`: This package, likely a custom package, seems to be responsible for performing some actions related to the Git repository.
4. `go-git/go-git`: This package provides a Go implementation of the Git version control system.

Now, let's dive into the code itself:

1. The code defines a `Package` struct, which holds information about a package, including its name, a list of files, and a pointer to a Git repository.

2. In the `main` function, the code first loads environment variables from a `.env` file using the `godotenv` package. This is a common practice for storing sensitive information like API keys or database credentials.

3. The code then retrieves the value of the `REPO_LINK` environment variable, which should contain the URL of the Git repository. If this variable is not set, the code will log an error and exit.

4. Finally, the code calls the `Reflexate` function from the `reflexia` package, passing the `REPO_LINK` as an argument. This function likely performs the desired actions related to the Git repository, such as cloning it, fetching changes, or performing some other operations.

In summary, this code snippet is designed to interact with a Git repository specified by the `REPO_LINK` environment variable. It loads environment variables from a `.env` file, retrieves the repository URL, and then calls a custom function `Reflexate` to perform actions related to the repository.
