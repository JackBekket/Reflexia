## Code Summary

### SummarizerService

The SummarizerService type holds the necessary information for interacting with the language model and generating summaries. It has the following fields:

- HelperURL: The URL of the helper service that will be used to generate the content instruction.
- Model: The name of the language model to be used for summarization.
- ApiToken: The API token required to access the language model.
- Network: The network to be used for communication with the language model.
- LlmOptions: Additional options for configuring the language model.

The SummarizerService has three main methods:

1. CodeSummaryRequest: This method takes a prompt and content string as input and calls the helper.GenerateContentInstruction function with the provided parameters. It returns the response and any error encountered.

2. SummarizeRequest: Similar to CodeSummaryRequest, this method also takes a prompt and content string as input and calls the helper.GenerateContentInstruction function. It returns the response and any error encountered.

3. SummarizeCode: This method takes a projectConfig as input and creates a map to store file paths and summaries. It then walks through the project directory using util.WalkDirIgnored and for each file, checks if it matches the file filter. If it matches, it reads the file content, calculates the relative path, and calls s.CodeSummaryRequest to get the summary. The summary is then stored in the map with the relative path as the key. Finally, the method returns the map and any error encountered.
