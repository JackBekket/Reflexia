## Summary

This code package provides functions for interacting with Git repositories. It includes functionalities for cloning repositories, creating and switching to new branches, pushing changes to remote repositories, and switching to the master branch. The package leverages the go-git library to perform these operations.

The Clone function clones a repository to a specified directory, while the CreateAndSwitch function creates a new branch and switches to it. The Push function pushes the current branch to the remote repository, and the SwitchToMaster function switches the repository to the master branch.

By using this package, developers can easily manage and manipulate Git repositories programmatically. This can be useful for automating tasks such as creating and merging branches, pushing code changes, and switching between different branches.
