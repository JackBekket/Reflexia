## Summary

This code package is designed to analyze Go code repositories and generate documentation for each package. It leverages the power of AI to create comprehensive summaries and descriptions of the code. The package begins by cloning the repository and identifying all the Go packages within it. For each package, it extracts the main Go file and any other files, then uses an AI model to generate documentation and summaries for the package. The generated documentation and summaries are then written to a Markdown file, which can be easily shared and used by developers.

The package utilizes several external libraries, including a GitHub API client for cloning repositories, a Go parser for analyzing the code, and an AI library for generating documentation and summaries. It also includes a custom function for extracting function declarations from the code and generating comments for them.

The package is designed to be easy to use and integrate into existing workflows. Developers can simply provide the URL of the repository they want to analyze, and the package will handle the rest. The generated documentation and summaries can then be used to improve the overall understanding and maintainability of the codebase.

In summary, this code package provides a powerful and efficient way to generate documentation for Go code repositories using AI. It is a valuable tool for developers who want to improve the quality and maintainability of their codebases.
