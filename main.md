## Package main

This package is the main entry point of the application. It imports several packages and defines a custom `Package` struct and the `main` function.

### Imported Packages

- `log`: This package provides functions for logging errors and other information.
- `os`: This package provides a way to use operating system dependent functionality.
- `reflexia`: This package provides a function for analyzing a repository.
- `git`: This package provides a way to interact with git repositories.
- `godotenv`: This package provides a way to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

### Struct `Package`

The `Package` struct is defined with two fields:

- `Name`: A string representing the name of the package.
- `Files`: A slice of strings representing the files in the package.
- `Repo`: A pointer to a `git.Repository` object representing the git repository.

### Function `main`

The `main` function is the entry point of the application. It does the following:

1. Loads environment variables from a `.env` file using the `godotenv.Load()` function. If there is an error, it logs the error and exits the application.
2. Gets the value of the `REPO_LINK` environment variable using the `os.Getenv()` function. If `REPO_LINK` is not set in the `.env` file, it logs an error and exits the application.
3. Calls the `reflexia.Reflexate()` function with `repoLink` as the argument. This function is responsible for analyzing the repository.

## Conclusion

This code is a simple application that uses the `reflexia` package to analyze a git repository. It loads environment variables from a `.env` file and uses the `REPO_LINK` environment variable to specify the repository to analyze.

Please note that the `reflexia.Reflexate()` function is not defined in this code, so this code will not run as is. The `reflexia.Reflexate()` function is expected to be defined elsewhere in the application.
