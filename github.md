## Summary

This code package provides functions for interacting with Git repositories. It includes functions for cloning repositories, creating and switching branches, pushing changes to remote repositories, and switching to the master branch.

The `Clone` function takes a repository URL and a directory as input and clones the repository to the specified directory. It uses the `go-git` library to perform the cloning operation.

The `CreateAndSwitch` function creates a new branch and switches to it. It takes a repository object and a branch name as input. The function first obtains a worktree from the repository and then creates a new branch with the given name. It then checks out the new branch, ensuring that it is created if it doesn't exist.

The `Push` function pushes the current branch to the remote repository. It takes a repository object and a branch name as input. The function first obtains the remote repository and then uses the `PushOptions` struct to specify the refspec for the push operation. Finally, it pushes the changes to the remote repository.

The `SwitchToMaster` function switches the current branch to the master branch. It takes a repository object as input and uses the `CheckoutOptions` struct to specify the branch to switch to. The function then checks out the master branch, ensuring that it is created if it doesn't exist.

In summary, this code package provides a set of functions for interacting with Git repositories, including cloning, creating and switching branches, pushing changes, and switching to the master branch. It uses the `go-git` library to perform these operations.
