# ai

## Summary

This Go code is a package named `ai` that provides several functions for generating summaries and documentation of code snippets. It uses the `github.com/JackBekket/hellper/lib/langchain` package for generating content based on instructions. The code also uses environment variables for configuration.

The package exports two functions: `GetSummaryPackage` and `CreateDoc`. The `GetSummaryPackage` function generates a summary of a given code snippet, while the `CreateDoc` function generates documentation for the same code snippet.

The code also includes helper functions for generating prompts for summarization and documentation, and for generating content based on these prompts. The `GenerateContent` function uses the `helper.GenerateContentInstruction` function to generate content based on the provided parameters.

The code also includes a `TestGenerateContent` function that tests the `GenerateContent` function by generating a summary of a given code snippet.

The code uses the `godotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file. The environment variables are used to configure the base URL, model name, API token, and network for the content generation.

Finally, the `getEnv` function is used to load the environment variables from the `.env` file. This function is called at the start of the `main` function.

Please note that the actual content generation is handled by the `helper.GenerateContentInstruction` function, which is not included in this code snippet.
