# reflexia

## Summary

This code package, named reflexia, is designed to analyze and document Go code. It starts by cloning a repository specified by the REPO_LINK environment variable. The package then walks through the files in the cloned repository, identifying Go files and extracting function declarations. For each function, it generates a comment using an AI model (likely an LLM like GPT-3) and appends it to a Markdown file for the package.

The package also includes a function called ParseContent, which takes a byte slice of code and a file path as input. It uses a regular expression to find function declarations in the code and then generates comments for each function using the AI model. The generated comments are returned as a slice of strings.

The main function, Reflexate, takes a repository URL as input and performs the following steps:

1. Loads environment variables from a .env file.
2. Clones the repository to a temporary directory.
3. Walks through the files in the cloned repository, identifying Go files and extracting function declarations.
4. Generates comments for each function using the AI model and appends them to a Markdown file for the package.
5. Removes the temporary directory.

In summary, this code package provides a way to automatically generate documentation for Go code by analyzing the code and using an AI model to generate comments for each function. The generated documentation is stored in Markdown files, which can be easily shared and used for various purposes.
