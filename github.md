# github

## Summary

This Go code package provides a set of functions for interacting with Git repositories. It focuses on cloning, creating branches, switching between branches, pushing changes, and switching to the master branch.

The package starts by defining a function called `Clone` that takes a repository URL and a local directory as input. It uses the `go-git` library to clone the repository to the specified directory. The function also includes an option to clone submodules recursively.

Next, the `CreateAndSwitch` function creates a new branch and switches the current working directory to that branch. It takes a Git repository object and the desired branch name as input. The function uses the `go-git` library to create the branch and checkout to it.

The `Push` function pushes the current branch to the remote repository. It takes a Git repository object and the branch name as input. The function uses the `go-git` library to push the changes to the remote repository.

Finally, the `SwitchToMaster` function switches the current working directory to the master branch. It takes a Git repository object as input and uses the `go-git` library to checkout to the master branch.

In summary, this code package provides a convenient way to perform common Git operations such as cloning, creating branches, switching between branches, pushing changes, and switching to the master branch. It leverages the `go-git` library to handle the underlying Git operations, making it easy for developers to integrate these functionalities into their Go projects.
