## Summary

This Go code is a package named `ai` that provides several functions for generating summaries and documentation of code snippets. It uses the `godotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file, and the `github.com/JackBekket/hellper/lib/langchain` package as a helper for generating content based on instructions.

The package exports two functions: `GetSummaryPackage` and `CreateDoc`. `GetSummaryPackage` generates a summary of a given code snippet, while `CreateDoc` generates documentation for the same code snippet.

The `GenerateSummaryPromt` and `GenerateDocumentationPromt` functions are used to create prompts for the AI model. The `GenerateContent` function is used to generate content based on these prompts.

The `TestGenerateContent` function is used to test the `GenerateContent` function. It loads environment variables for the AI URL, model, API token, and network, generates a summary prompt, and then generates the content.

The `getEnv` function is used to load the environment variables from the `.env` file. This function is called at the start of the `main` function.

The code is imported from the `github.com/joho/godotenv` package and the `log` package from the standard library.

The code is designed to be used in a specific environment, where the AI URL, model, API token, and network are set in the `.env` file. The `.env` file should be located in the same directory as the Go code.

The code is well-documented and follows Go's idiomatic coding practices.
