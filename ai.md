## Summary

This code package provides a set of functions to generate summaries, documentation, and comments for code. It leverages an external AI service to perform these tasks. The package first defines several variables, including instructions for generating summaries, documentation, and comments for functions. It also defines a function to generate a prompt for summarizing code, generating documentation, and generating comments for a function.

The package then defines a function to generate content using an AI service, taking parameters such as the base URL, prompt, model name, API token, and network. It also includes options for repetition penalty, maximum tokens, and stop words. The function returns the generated content.

The package also includes functions to test the content generation process, get a summary of a package, create documentation for code, and generate comments for a function. These functions utilize the previously defined variables and functions to perform their respective tasks.

Finally, the package includes a function to load environment variables from a .env file, ensuring that the necessary parameters for the AI service are available.

In summary, this code package provides a comprehensive set of functions to generate summaries, documentation, and comments for code using an external AI service. It leverages environment variables and options for customization, allowing users to tailor the process to their specific needs.
