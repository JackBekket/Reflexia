## Summary

This code package provides functions for generating summaries, documentation, and comments for code using an AI model. It leverages the LangChain library and requires environment variables for the AI URL, model name, API token, and network.

The package includes functions for generating summaries, documentation, and comments for code. It also provides a function to test the generation process with a given initial prompt.

Here's a breakdown of the functions:

1. GenerateFunctionPromt(code string) (string): Generates a prompt for a function, including the code and instructions for the AI model.

2. GenerateSummaryPromt(code string) (string): Generates a prompt for a code summary, including the code and instructions for the AI model.

3. GenerateDocumentationPromt(code string) (string): Generates a prompt for code documentation, including the code and instructions for the AI model.

4. GenerateContent(base_url string, promt string, model_name string, api_token string, network string) (string): Generates content using the provided prompt, model, and API token. It also includes options for repetition penalty, stop words, and maximum tokens.

5. TestGenerateContent(initial_promt string) (string): Tests the content generation process with a given initial prompt.

6. GetSummaryPackage(initial_promt string) (string): Returns the summary of the code based on the initial prompt.

7. CreateDoc(code string) (string): Generates documentation for the given code using the AI model.

8. GenerateCommentForFunction(code string) (string): Generates a comment for a function based on the given code using the AI model.

9. getEnv(): Loads environment variables from a .env file.

In summary, this code package provides a set of functions for generating summaries, documentation, and comments for code using an AI model. It requires environment variables for the AI URL, model name, API token, and network.
