## Summary

This Go code provides a set of functions for interacting with Git repositories using the go-git library. It includes functionality for cloning a repository, creating a new branch, switching to a branch, and pushing changes to a remote repository.

The `Clone` function clones a repository from a given URL to a specified directory. It prints the git clone command that would be executed, but does not actually execute it.

The `CreateAndSwitch` function creates a new branch and switches to it. It takes a git.Repository and a branch name as arguments.

The `Push` function pushes the current branch to the remote repository. It takes a git.Repository and a branch name as arguments.

The `SwitchToMaster` function switches the current branch to the master branch. It takes a git.Repository as an argument.

Please note that the commented out part of the `Push` function is not used in the provided code.

This code is a part of a larger application and is used to manage Git repositories.
