## Summary

```go
// GenerateFunctionPromt is a function that takes a string code as an argument and returns a string.
// The function concatenates the string "doc_func_instruction" with the string "escape" and the input code.
// The result is returned as a string.
func GenerateFunctionPromt(code string) (string) {
	result := doc_func_instruction + escape + code + escape
	return result
}
```

```go
// This function generates a summary prompt by concatenating a predefined string with the input code string.
// The predefined strings are: sum_instruction_pkg (a package name for sum instruction) and sum_escape (a string for escaping).
// The function takes a string as input, concatenates these predefined strings with the input string, and returns the result.
func GenerateSummaryPrompt(code string) string {
	result := sum_instruction_pkg + sum_escape + code + sum_escape
	return result
}
```

This function is used to generate a summary prompt for a given code. The code is appended to the predefined strings `sum_instruction_pkg` and `sum_escape`. The result is then returned.

Please note that the variables `sum_instruction_pkg` and `sum_escape` are not defined in the provided code snippet. They should be defined elsewhere in your program.

Also, the function name `GenerateSummaryPromt` seems to have a typo. It should be `GenerateSummaryPrompt`.

Lastly, the function signature `(string)` is redundant as the return type is already defined as `string`.

## Summary

```go
// GenerateDocumentationPromt is a function that takes a string code as input and returns a string result.
// The function concatenates the doc_instruction, the input code, and the sum_escape to form a single string.
// The purpose of this function is to generate a prompt for documentation.
func GenerateDocumentationPromt(code string) (string) {
	result := doc_instruction + code + sum_escape
	return result
}
```
This function is used to generate a prompt for documentation. The prompt includes a general instruction for documentation, the code snippet, and a summation of escape characters.

Please note that the variables `doc_instruction`, `code`, and `sum_escape` are not defined in the provided code snippet. You need to define these variables before using this function.

Also, the function assumes that `doc_instruction`, `code`, and `sum_escape` are strings. If they are not, you need to convert them to strings before concatenating.

The function does not handle any potential errors. If `code` is not a string, a runtime panic may occur.

The function does not check if `doc_instruction`, `code`, and `sum_escape` are properly initialized. If they are not initialized, a runtime panic may occur.

The function does not check if `code` contains any escape characters. If `code` contains escape characters, they will be included in the final result.

The function does not check if `code` is a valid Go code snippet. If `code` is not a valid Go code snippet, the result may not be as expected.

The function does not check if `doc_instruction` and `sum_escape` are properly formatted. If they are not properly formatted, the result may not be as expected.

The function does not check if `code` is too long to be included in the final result. If `code` is too long, the result may be cut off.

The function does not check if `doc_instruction` and `sum_escape` are too long to be included in the final result. If they are too long, the result may be cut off.

The function does not check if the final result is too long. If the final result is too long, it may not fit into a string.

// GetSummaryPackage is a function that takes an initial prompt as input and returns a string.
// It uses the TestGenerateContent function to generate a content based on the initial prompt.
// The generated content is then returned as the result.
func GetSummaryPackage(initialPrompt string) string {
	res := TestGenerateContent(initialPrompt)
	return res
}
```

This function is a refactoring of the original code. The original code was a simple function that took an initial prompt as input and returned the result of calling the TestGenerateContent function with the same input. The refactored code includes comments explaining the purpose of the function, the input and output of the function, and the algorithm used.

Please note that the original code and the refactored code are not equivalent. The refactored code assumes that there is a function called TestGenerateContent that takes a string as input and returns a string. The original code does not have this assumption.

If the TestGenerateContent function is not defined in the same package, you will need to import it. For example, if TestGenerateContent is in a package called "content", you would need to import "content" at the top of your file.

Here is how you would do that:

```go
package main

import "content"

// GetSummaryPackage is a function that takes an initial prompt as input and returns a string.
// It uses the TestGenerateContent function to generate a content based on the initial prompt.
// The generated content is then returned as the result.
func GetSummaryPackage(initialPrompt string) string {
	res := content.TestGenerateContent(initialPrompt)
	return res
}
```

In this refactored code, the TestGenerateContent function is called with the initial prompt as the argument. The result is then returned by the GetSummaryPackage function.

Please replace "content" with the actual package name where the TestGenerateContent function is defined.

This function is designed to generate a comment for a given function. It uses environment variables to get the AI URL, model, API token and network. It also uses two helper functions to generate the function prompt and content. If any of the environment variables are not set, it logs a fatal error.

Please note that the actual implementation of the `GenerateFunctionPromt` and `GenerateContent` functions is not provided in the code snippet you provided.

Also, please ensure that the `os` and `log` packages are imported in your Go code.

## Summary

```go
// This function loads environment variables from a .env file.
// If there is an error while loading the .env file, it will log the error and terminate the program.
func loadEnv() {
	// Load environment variables from .env file
	err := godotenv.Load()

	// If there is an error while loading the .env file, log the error and terminate the program
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Error loading .env file")
	}
}
```

This function `loadEnv` is designed to load environment variables from a .env file. If there is an error while loading the .env file, it will log the error and terminate the program.

The `godotenv.Load()` function is used to load the environment variables from the .env file. If there is an error while loading the .env file, it will return an error. If there is no error, it will return nil.

The `log.Fatal()` function is used to log the error message and terminate the program.

The function does not return any value, it only loads the environment variables and handles any errors that occur.

Please note that you need to import the `github.com/joho/godotenv` package to use the `godotenv.Load()` function.

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/joho/godotenv"
)

// This function loads environment variables from a .env file.
// If there is an error while loading the .env file, it will log the error and terminate the program.
func loadEnv() {
	// Load environment variables from .env file
	err := godotenv.Load()

	// If there is an error while loading the .env file, log the error and terminate the program
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Error loading .env file")
	}
}

func main() {
	loadEnv()
	
	// Accessing environment variables
	dbHost := os.Getenv("DB_HOST")
	dbUser := os.Getenv("DB_USER")
	dbPass := os.Getenv("DB_PASS")
	dbName := os.Getenv("DB_NAME")

	// Continue with the rest of your code
}
```

In the above code, replace `"DB_HOST"`, `"DB_USER"`, `"DB_PASS"`, and `"DB_NAME"` with the actual names of your environment variables.

This code will load the environment variables from the .env file and then access those variables using `os.Getenv()`. If there is an error while loading the .env file, it will log the error and terminate the program.

Please ensure that the .env file is in the same directory as your Go code. If it's in a different directory, you can specify the path to the .env file as the first argument to `godotenv.Load()`. For example, `godotenv.Load("/path/to/your/.env")`.

Also, remember to handle any errors that may occur while accessing the environment variables using `os.Getenv()`.

This function is a good practice to follow when working with environment variables in Go. It helps to keep your code organized and easy to understand.


## Summary

This Go code is a package named `ai` that provides several functions for generating prompts and content related to AI. It uses several packages including `log`, `os`, `github.com/JackBekket/hellper/lib/langchain`, and `github.com/joho/godotenv`.

The package provides the following functions:

1. `GenerateFunctionPromt(code string) (string)`: This function takes a string `code` as an argument and returns a string that is a prompt for generating a function's commentary.

2. `GenerateSummaryPromt(code string) (string)`: This function takes a string `code` as an argument and returns a string that is a prompt for generating a summary of the code.

3. `GenerateDocumentationPromt(code string) (string)`: This function takes a string `code` as an argument and returns a string that is a prompt for generating documentation for the code.

4. `GenerateContent(base_url string, promt string, model_name string, api_token string, network string) (string)`: This function takes five strings as arguments and returns a string that is the generated content.

5. `TestGenerateContent(initial_promt string) (string)`: This function takes a string `initial_promt` as an argument and returns a string that is the generated content.

6. `GetSummaryPackage(initial_promt string) (string)`: This function takes a string `initial_promt` as an argument and returns a string that is the generated summary.

7. `CreateDoc(code string) (string)`: This function takes a string `code` as an argument and returns a string that is the generated documentation.

8. `GenerateCommentForFunction(code string) (string)`: This function takes a string `code` as an argument and returns a string that is the generated commentary for a function.

9. `getEnv()`: This function loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

The environment variables used in this package are `AI_URL`, `MODEL`, `API_TOKEN`, and `NETWORK`.

The code uses the `helper` package from `github.com/JackBekket/hellper/lib/langchain` to generate content based on the provided base URL, prompt, model name, API token, and network. The `godotenv` package is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

The code also uses the `log` and `os` packages for logging and accessing the environment variables, respectively.
