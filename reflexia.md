# reflexia

## Summary

This code package, named "reflexia," is designed to analyze and document Go source code using artificial intelligence (AI). It takes a Git repository URL as input and performs the following steps:

1. Clones the repository to a temporary directory.
2. Walks through the files in the repository, identifying Go files (those with the ".go" extension).
3. For each Go file, it extracts the function declarations and uses an AI model to generate comments for each function.
4. Creates a Markdown file for each package, containing the generated comments and other relevant information.

The package uses the following external libraries:

- "go/parser" for parsing Go source code.
- "go/token" for managing file positions and tokens.
- "log" for logging messages.
- "os" for interacting with the operating system.
- "path/filepath" for working with file paths.
- "regexp" for regular expressions.
- "github" for interacting with GitHub repositories.
- "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5" for cloning Git repositories.
- "github.com/joho/godotenv" for loading environment variables from a ".env" file.

The package also includes a function called "ParseContent" that takes a byte slice of Go code and a file path as input. It uses the "getFunctions" function to extract function declarations from the code and then uses an AI model to generate comments for each function. The generated comments are returned as a slice of strings.

The "getFunctions" function uses a regular expression to find function declarations in the input string. It returns a slice of strings containing the matched function declarations.

Overall, this code package provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing and documenting Go source code using AI. It automates the process of extracting function declarations and generating comments, which can save developers time and effort.
