# github

## Overview
The `github` package provides functionality for interacting with GitHub repositories, including creating pull requests (PRs), managing working directories, and handling Git operations. It is designed to automate documentation-related tasks such as committing changes, creating PRs, and managing repository branches.

## File Structure
- `pull_request.go`: Implements PR creation, branch management, and Git operations.
- `workdir.go`: Manages working directories, repository cloning, and branch handling.

## Configuration Options
All configuration options are **fixed** and cannot be modified:
- `PRTitle`: "Reflexia autodoc"
- `PRBody`: "This commit is autogenerated using Reflexia."
- `CommitMessage`: "Reflexia autodoc"
- `CommitName`: "Reflexia"
- `CommitEmail`: "reflexia@swarmind.ai"
- `BranchFormat`: `%s_autodoc` (hard-coded, not configurable)

## Behavior and Limitations
- **GitHub Only**: Supports only GitHub repos (host must be `github.com`).
- **Fixed Authorship**: Commit author information (name/email) is fixed and cannot be configured.
- **No SSH Support**: Uses HTTP Basic Auth only; SSH authentication is not handled.
- **No Rate Limiting**: Does not handle GitHub API rate limiting.
- **Idempotent PRs**: PR creation is idempotent (returns existing PR if it exists).
- **Branch Handling**: Branch names are generated using `BranchFormat`; invalid branch names are rejected.
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - Does not handle invalid GitHub tokens or credentials.
  - Does not handle network errors during API calls.
  - `PushOptions` uses `Force: true`, which may overwrite existing branches.
  - `cdAfter` paths are ignored in some cases (e.g., `.../tree/branch/dir1/dir2`).

## Notes
- The package is part of a larger system (e.g., Reflexia) for automating documentation workflows.
- No TODOs or unclear logic in the provided code.
