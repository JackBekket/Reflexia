# reflexia

## Summary


The code you've provided is a Go program that uses AI to generate documentation and summaries for Go code packages. It uses the `go/parser` package to parse Go files, the `go/token` package to provide position information, and the `regexp` package to find function declarations in the code.

The program has a `Reflexate` function that takes a repository URL as input. It clones the repository to a temporary directory, then walks through the files in the repository. For each Go file, it parses the file and extracts the package name and the file paths. It also creates a Markdown file for each package and writes the package name to the file.

The program then walks through the files again, this time generating documentation and summaries for each file. It uses AI to generate comments and summaries for each function in the file. The comments and summaries are written to the Markdown file for the package.

Finally, the program removes the temporary directory.

The `ParseContent` function takes a byte slice and a file path as input. It uses a regular expression to find function declarations in the input data. It then uses AI to generate comments for each function and returns the comments as a slice of strings.

The `getFunctions` function takes a string as input and uses a regular expression to find all function declarations in the input string. It returns the function declarations as a slice of strings.

Please note that the AI part of this program is not implemented yet. The `ai.GenerateCommentForFunction` and `ai.TestGenerateContent` functions are placeholders for the AI functionality.
